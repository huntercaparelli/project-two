          How a Billionaire Team Owner Pays a Lower Tax Rate Than LeBron

          A massive tax break allows owners to report huge losses to the IRS,
          even if their teams are profitable, and save themselves hundreds of
          millions.

          <br />
          Ballmer isn’t alone. ProPublica reviewed tax information for dozens of
          team owners across the four largest American pro sports leagues.
          Owners frequently report incomes for their teams that are millions
          below their real-world earnings, according to the tax records,
          previously leaked team financial records and interviews with experts.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          They include Shahid Khan, an automotive tycoon who made use of at
          least $79 million in losses from a stake in the Jacksonville Jaguars
          even as his football team has consistently been projected to bring in
          millions a year. And Leonard Wilf, a New Jersey real estate developer
          who owns the Minnesota Vikings with family members, has taken $66
          million in losses from his minority stake in the team.

        />
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">
          In a statement, Khan responded: “We’re a nation of laws. U.S. Congress
          passes them. In the case of tax laws, the IRS applies and enforces the
          regulations, which are absolute. We simply and fully comply with those
          very IRS regulations.” Wilf didn’t respond to questions.

          <br />
          Ballmer’s spokesperson declined to answer specific questions, but said
          “Steve has always paid the taxes he owes, and has publicly noted that
          he would personally be fine with paying more.”

          to the government by avoiding the types of income that can be taxed.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          The records also show how some of the richest people on the planet use
          their membership in the exclusive club of pro sports team owners to
          further lower their tax bills.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          The records upend conventional wisdom about how taxation works in
          America. Billionaire owners are consistently paying lower tax rates
          than their millionaire players—and often lower even than the rates
          paid by the workers who staff their stadiums. The massive reductions
          on personal tax bills that owners glean from their teams come on top
          of the much-criticized subsidies the teams get from local governments
          for new stadiums and further deplete federal coffers that fund
          everything from the military to medical research to food stamps and
          other safety net programs.
