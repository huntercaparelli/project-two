          How Sports Owners<br />Use Their Teams to<br />Avoid Millions in Taxes

          Owners like Steve Ballmer can take the kinds of deductions on team
          assets—everything from media deals to player contracts—that
          industrialists take on factory equipment. That helps them pay lower
          tax rates than players and even stadium workers.

        <h2 class="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          At a concession stand at Staples Center in Los Angeles, Adelaide Avila
          was pingponging between pouring beers, wiping down counters and taking
          out the trash. Her Los Angeles Lakers were playing their hometown
          rival, the Clippers, but Avila was working too hard to follow the
          March 2019 game.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          When she filed taxes for her previous year’s labors at the arena and
          her second job driving for Uber, the 50-year-old Avila reported making
          $44,810. The federal government took a 14.1% cut.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          On the court that night, the players were also hard at work. None more
          so than LeBron James. The Lakers star was suffering through a painful
          strained groin injury, but he still put up more points and played more
          minutes than any other player.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          In his tax return, James reported making $124 million in 2018. He paid
          a federal income tax rate of 35.9%. Not surprisingly, it was more than
          double the rate paid by Avila.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          The wealthiest person in the building that night, in all likelihood,
          was Steve Ballmer, owner of the Clippers. The evening was decidedly
          less arduous for the billionaire former CEO of Microsoft. He sat
          courtside, in a pink dress shirt and slacks, surrounded by friends.
          His legs were outstretched, his shoes almost touching the sideline.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          Ballmer had reason to smile: His Clippers won. But even if they
          hadn’t, his ownership of the team was reaping him massive tax
          benefits.
        </p>

          alt="Image of Lebron James making a layup."
        />
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">
          For the prior year, Ballmer reported making $656 million. The dollar
          figure he paid in taxes was large, $78 million; but as a percentage of
          what he made, it was tiny. Records reviewed by ProPublica show his
          federal income tax rate was just 12%.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          That’s a third of the rate James paid, even though Ballmer made five
          times as much as the superstar player. Ballmer’s rate was also lower
          than Avila’s—even though Ballmer’s income was almost 15,000 times
          greater than the concession worker’s.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          Ballmer pays such a low rate, in part, because of a provision of the
          U.S. tax code. When someone buys a business, they’re often able to
          deduct almost the entire sale price against their income during the
          ensuing years. That allows them to pay less in taxes. The underlying
          logic is that the purchase price was composed of assets—buildings,
          equipment, patents and more—that degrade over time and should be
          counted as expenses.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          This allows Ballmer to perform a kind of financial magic trick. If he
          profits from the Clippers, he can—legally—inform the IRS that he is
          losing money, thus saving vast sums on his taxes. If the Clippers are
          unprofitable in a given year, he can tell the IRS he’s losing vastly
          more.

        />
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">
          Glimpses of the Clippers’ real-world financial results show the
          business has often been profitable. Those include audited financials
          disclosed in a Bank of America report just before Ballmer bought the
          team, as well as NBA records that were leaked after he became owner.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-IRS">
          But IRS records obtained by ProPublica show the Clippers have reported
          $700 million in losses for tax purposes in recent years. Not only does
          Ballmer not have to pay tax on any real-world Clippers profits, he can
          use the tax write-off to offset his other income.
