          How Sports Owners<br />Use Their Teams to<br />Avoid Millions in Taxes

          A review of federal tax records from 2017 and 2018 shows that the tax
          code favors team owners over wage-earning athletes. Here are some
          prominent examples:

          Figures above reflect adjusted gross income for 2017 and 2018 added
          together. The tax rates were calculated using the total federal income
          taxes paid during those two years, including both the employees’ and
          employers’ share of payroll taxes.

        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          The history of team ownership as a way to avoid taxes goes back almost
          a century. Bill Veeck, owner of the Cleveland Indians in the 1940s and
          later the Chicago White Sox, stated it plainly in his memoir: “Look,
          we play the Star Spangled Banner before every game. You want us to pay
          income taxes too?”
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          Veeck is credited with convincing the IRS to accept a tax maneuver
          even he described as a “gimmick.” Player salaries were already treated
          as a deductible business expense for a team. That was not
          controversial in the slightest.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          But Veeck dreamed up an innovation, a way to get a second tax
          deduction for the same players: depreciation. The way he accomplished
          this was by separately buying the contracts before the old company was
          liquidated, instead of transferring them to the new company as had
          been done before. That meant that the contracts were treated as a
          separate asset. The value a new owner assigned to that asset when he
          bought the team could be used to offset taxes on team profits, as well
          as any other income he might have. (Defenders of the practice contend
          that it’s not double-dipping since the deductions are taken against
          two separate pools of money: the money used to purchase the team and
          the day-to-day operating budget.)
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          Team owners, Veeck wrote in his memoir, had won “a tax write-off that
          could have been figured out by a Texas oilman. It wasn’t figured out
          by a Texas oilman. It was figured out by a Chicago hustler. Me.”
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          Once the IRS accepted this premise, the natural next step — owners
          assigning as large a portion of the total team purchase price as
          possible to player contracts — was elevated into a sport of its own.
          Decades ago, Paul Beeston, who was president of the Toronto Blue Jays
          and president of Major League Baseball at various times, famously
          described the result: “Under generally accepted accounting principles,
          I could turn a $4 million profit into a $2 million loss and I could
          get every national accounting firm to agree with me.”

        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          The depreciation of tangible assets, and their decay over time, is
          often intuitive. A machine in a factory and a fleet of cars have more
          obvious fair market values and life spans before business owners will
          have to pay to replace them. Take, for example, a newspaper business
          with a printing press that cost $10 million and will last for, say, 20
          years. The idea of depreciation is that the newspaper owner could
          deduct a piece of that $10 million every year for the 20-year lifespan
          of the press.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          But amortization, the term for depreciating nonphysical assets, was
          less straightforward. Sports teams are often mainly composed of these
          assets. Valuing and assigning a life span to a player contract or a TV
          deal was more subjective and thus vulnerable to aggressive tax
          maneuvers by team owners.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          Several NBA teams claimed that more than 90% — in one case, 100% — of
          their value consisted of player contracts that could be written off on
          the owner’s taxes, according to league financials that emerged in an
          early 1970s congressional investigation.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          By that time the IRS had begun a series of
          <a
            class="paragraph-link"

            >challenges</a
          >
          of valuation methods by team owners, part of a larger fight across
          industries about how business owners should be allowed to write off
          so-called intangible assets. The tax agency insisted that companies
          should only be able to write off assets with a limited useful life.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          In an effort to stop the endless litigation, Congress inaugurated the
          modern era of amortization by simplifying the rules in 1993: Under the
          new regime, the purchaser of a business would be allowed, over the
          span of 15 years, to write off more types of intangible assets. This
          might have been welcome news for the sports business. But Congress
          explicitly excluded the industry from the law.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          Following lobbying by Major League Baseball, in 2004, sports teams
          were granted the right to use this deduction as part of a tax bill
          signed by President George W. Bush, himself a former part owner of the
          Texas Rangers. Now, team owners could write off the price they paid
          not just for player contracts, but also a range of other items such as
          TV and radio contracts and even goodwill, an amorphous accounting
          concept that represents the value of a business’ reputation.
          Altogether, those assets typically amount to 90% or more of the price
          paid for a team.

          That means when billionaires buy teams, the law allows them to treat
          almost all of what they bought, including assets that don’t lose
          value, as deteriorating over time. A team’s franchise rights, which
          never expire, automatically get treated like a pharmaceutical
          company’s patent on a blockbuster drug, which has a finite life span.
          In reality, the right to operate a franchise in one of the major
          leagues has in the last few decades been a license to print money: In
          the past two decades, the average value of basketball, football,
          baseball and hockey teams has grown by more than 500%.

          ProPublica uncovered the tax breaks used by team owners by dissecting
          reports sent to the IRS that capture the profit or loss of a business.
          Still, untangling the precise benefits can be difficult. For example,
          some owners hold their team stakes in companies that also had
          unrelated assets — a corporate nesting doll that makes it impossible
          to determine the losses a team produced. The examples mentioned in
          this article are instances in which it appears the owners did not
          intermingle assets and the team’s ownership structure is clear based
          on ProPublica’s analysis of the tax records, court documents,
          corporate registration data and news reports.

          When Steve Ballmer offered to buy the Clippers in 2014 for a record
          sum, the team’s longtime owner, Donald Sterling, was taken aback.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          “I’m curious about one thing,” Sterling said at a meeting later
          recounted by his lawyer.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          “Of course, what is the question?” Ballmer responded.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          Sterling proceeded: “You really have $2 billion?”
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          The size of the offer was impressive considering the context. In 1981,
          Sterling had paid $12.5 million for the club. In the three decades
          that followed, Sterling had become notorious for neglecting and
          mistreating the team. He didn’t provide a training facility for years,
          forcing the team to practice at the gym of a local junior college. He
          heckled his own players during games. After games, Sterling was said
          to parade friends through the locker room so they could gawk at the
          players’ bodies.

        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          TV deals also grew in value. The Clippers had little fan support, and
          they oscillated between being league bottom-dwellers and a middling
          franchise. But before Sterling sold the team, the Clippers were
          expected to sign a new local media deal worth two to three times more
          than their previous deal.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          The beginning of the end of Sterling’s tenure came when he was
          recorded by his mistress telling her not to bring Black people to
          Clippers games. The NBA moved to force Sterling out. Ballmer swooped
          in, outbidding Oprah Winfrey and others. (ProPublica couldn’t reach
          Sterling for comment. His wife, Shelly, who co-owned the Clippers with
          him, defended their tenure in emails to ProPublica, saying they
          weren’t the only owners whose team didn’t own a practice facility and
          suggesting her husband did not heckle players. “I GUESS WHEN THERE IS
          NOTHING TO WRITE ABOUT WHY NOT TRY TO WRITE SOME SCUM,” she wrote.)
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          Ballmer, one of the richest people in the world, wasn’t just motivated
          by his love for basketball. He expected the team to be profitable.
          “It’s not a cheap price, but when you’re used to looking at tech
          companies with huge risk, no earnings and huge multiples, this doesn’t
          look like the craziest thing I’ve ever acquired,” he said at the time.
          “There’s much less risk. There’s real earnings in this business.”
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          Two years later, as the league negotiated a new contract with the
          players union, Ballmer portrayed the team’s finances in a much
          different light. “I’m a new owner and I’ve heard this is the golden
          age of basketball economics. You should tell our finance people that,”
          he told a reporter in 2016. “We’re sitting there looking at red ink,
          and it’s real red ink. I know, it shows up on my tax returns.”
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          But losses on a tax return don’t necessarily mean losses, as large or
          at all, in the real world.

        <p class="paragraph">
          Ballmer was acquiring a team that had skyrocketed in value over the
          previous decade. And there was the benefit for his taxes: He was
          allowed to start treating the Clippers — including those player
          contracts and TV deals — as if they were losing value.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          From 2014 to 2018, records show Ballmer reported a total of $700
          million in losses from his ownership of the Clippers, almost certainly
          composed mainly of paper losses from amortization.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br />
          The evidence examined by ProPublica showed the Clippers have often
          been profitable, though many of the glimpses into the team’s finances
          are from before Ballmer took over. Leaked NBA records during Ballmer’s
          tenure showed the Clippers in the black as recently as 2017. Audited
          financials disclosed in the Bank of America report just before the
          sale showed the team netting $14 million and $18 million in the two
          years before Ballmer took over, with projected growth in the future.
          Tax records for the pre-Ballmer era examined by ProPublica showed the
          team consistently making millions in profits.

          has also estimated the team generates millions in annual profits.

        <p class="paragraph-Steve">
          <br />
          Nevertheless, Ballmer reported staggering losses from the Clippers to
          the IRS. Those losses allowed him to reduce the taxes he owed on the
          billions he has reaped from Microsoft stock sales and dividends.
          Owning the Clippers cut his tax bill by about $140 million in just
          five years, according to a ProPublica analysis.
